		<h2>SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES</h2>
		<p>This project seeks to lower the barrier of entry into the field of plant acoustics research by addressing the challenges of affordability and technical complexity. The cornerstone of this project is the novel use of cost-effective ultrasonic USB microphones, reducing the setup cost to less than a tenth of the current state of the art. </p>
		</br>
		<p>An extensive suite of software solutions was built, enabling these cheap microphones to work on par, and even exceed more standard condenser microphones in some core capabilities.</p>
		</br>
		<p>The entire tool chain, consisting of recording software, data storage and multiple processing engines is abstracted behind an easy to use interface. To further increase the accessibility of research in this field, the entire project will be published under an open-source license.</p>

		<h2>COLLABORATIONS</h2>
		<h3>VBCF PHENOBOX TEAM</h3>
		<p>We're working closely with the PHENOBox team at the Vienna BioCenter Core Facilities (VBCF). Their expertise in automated plant phenotyping is invaluable for our project. Together, we're developing a specialized box equipped with high-end ultrasound microphones.</p>
		<h3>ALEXANDRA POSEKANY</h3>
		<p>Alexandra Posekany, an assistant professor at the Vienna University of Technology, is our academic backbone. Specializing in computational statistics, Bayesian statistics, and data science, she guides us through the complexities of sound classification and data analysis.</p>

		<!-- RESEARCH BASIS content here -->
		<h2>RESEARCH BASIS</h2>
		<p>Our project, PlantWhispers, is deeply influenced by the groundbreaking study titled "Sounds emitted by plants under stress are airborne and informative" published in Cell. This study uncovers the fascinating world of plant bioacoustics, revealing that plants emit ultrasonic airborne sounds when under stress. Utilizing machine learning models, the researchers were able to classify these sounds based on the plant's condition, such as dehydration level and injury. This work not only opens new avenues in understanding plant-environment interactions but also holds significant implications for agriculture.</p>

		<h2>Project Updates</h2>
		<h3>16. January 2024</h3>
		<p>We 3D printed our own housing and a movable arm for the microphones, and then installed them in the PhenoBox. The box is located in a laboratory that was made available to us by our collaborator, BioCenter.  We have also been given a place in one of their plant chambers, in which plants for our Project are growing. We have already been able to use this for a test recording. In the recording, we were able to recognize the first plant sounds on our own audio tracks recorded using the ultrasonic microphones. </p>

	<section id="findings">
		<!-- Sconclusion content here -->
		<h2>Findings</h2>
		<p>TThis project demonstrated that using cheaper ultrasonic USB microphones normally used to record animal noises can effectively be deployed for plant acoustic research. For this purpose, an extensive suite of software and hardware solutions was build. A recorder made up from a Raspberry Pi 5, two Dodotronic Ultramic 384K EVO ultrasonic microphones, and a HC-SR04 ultrasound distance sensor used for synchronization records data unattended and streams the data to a server. On the server, all data is stored redundantly, labeled and pre-processed to minimize noise and reduce storage requirement. After being stored as individual clicking sounds in a database, the data is processed in a second analysis step, resulting in usable information about the plant's condition. A user-friendly web interface is used to access both the interpretations of the data, and the data itself.</p>
