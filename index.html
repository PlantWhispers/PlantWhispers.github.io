    <h2>SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES</h2>
    <p>The primary objective of PlantWhispers is to develop a robust, open-source infrastructure for capturing and analysing high-frequency sounds emitted by plants under stress. This infrastructure will consist of both hardware and software components. The initial hardware will consist of an ultrasonic microphone coupled with a Raspberry Pi for data storage and interpretation. Future iterations may explore more tailored hardware solutions.</p>
    <p>On the software side, we aim to cover the entire pipeline from data acquisition to user interface. While our initial approach to data analysis tends towards regression models, we're open to using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) where appropriate.</p>
    <p>Although our focus is not on biological research per se, we will carry out preliminary studies to validate the infrastructure. The ultimate goal is to publish our findings and design plans as a contribution to the scientific community, regardless of the success of the project. We have no commercial aspirations; our designs and software will remain open source for the benefit of researchers worldwide.</p>

    <h2>COLLABORATIONS</h2>
    <h3>VBCF PHENOBOX TEAM</h3>
    <p>We're working closely with the PHENOBox team at the Vienna BioCenter Core Facilities (VBCF). Their expertise in automated plant phenotyping is invaluable for our project. Together, we're developing a specialized box equipped with high-end ultrasound microphones.</p>
    <h3>ALEXANDRA POSEKANY</h3>
    <p>Alexandra Posekany, an assistant professor at the Vienna University of Technology, is our academic backbone. Specializing in computational statistics, Bayesian statistics, and data science, she guides us through the complexities of sound classification and data analysis.</p>

    <h2>RESEARCH BASIS</h2>
    <p>Our project, PlantWhispers, is deeply influenced by the groundbreaking study titled "Sounds emitted by plants under stress are airborne and informative" published in Cell. This study uncovers the fascinating world of plant bioacoustics, revealing that plants emit ultrasonic airborne sounds when under stress. Utilizing machine learning models, the researchers were able to classify these sounds based on the plant's condition, such as dehydration level and injury. This work not only opens new avenues in understanding plant-environment interactions but also holds significant implications for agriculture.</p>
